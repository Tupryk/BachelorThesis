# Status update for the 17th of July 2024 (13 weeks left)

## Progress
- Implemented the standard residual calculation without nn on c.
- Compared c tree and nn inference times

## Plans for next week

## To discuss
- The way that the pwm values get normalized is like this: pwm_1 = [pwm / np.linalg.norm(pwm_1) for pwm in pwm_1]. The length of the pwm_i vectors varies a bit at each flight. Is this something to consider?

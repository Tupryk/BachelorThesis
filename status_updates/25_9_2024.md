# Status update for the 25th of September 2024 (3 weeks left)

## Progress
- Recorder inference time in miccroseconds for each method. Added it to the thesis results
- Tried recording data for the brushless cf, ran into multiple issues

## Plans for next week
- Improve german abstract
- Why are the results like this analysis paragraph
- Redo sim
- Add brushless results
- Latex font in matplotlib
- Add axis labels (units)
- More general dynamics learning - residual learning is just one of them, look at robot learning lectures
- Intro longer
- More citation
- Finish brushless tests
- Change microseconds to hz

## To discuss
- Thesis

# Status update for the 19th of June 2024 (17 weeks left)

## Progress
- New residual calculations with higher magnitude.
- Created a new model (Low accuracy on Z-force and torques.)

## Plans for next week

## To discuss
- The polynomial used in jana's thesis to calculate the force of a rotor given pwm (Equation 14), does not match the polynomial given in https://github.com/IMRCLab/crazyflie-system-id. Which one is correct?
- Jana used pwm_1 = preprocessing.normalize(data['pwm.m1_pwm'][None])[0] for her residual calculation. What was this for? Should it be there?
- The paper "System Identification of the Crazyflie 2.0 Nano Quadrocopter" by Julian FÃ¶rster defines the R matrix when explaining the drag model as "the rotation of the body frame with respect to the inertial frame". Is this the same as the rotation with respect to the world frame?
- This was wrong acc = R @ np.array([data['acc.x'][i], data['acc.y'][i], data['acc.z'][i]]). R has to be inverted. Still, the results dont change much.
- I believe jana's residual calculation has another bug in this line: prev_a_vel = a_vel = np.array([data['gyro.x'][i-1], data['gyro.y'][i-1], data['gyro.z'][i-1]])*d2r, "prev_a_vel" and "a_vel" are set the the same value.
- Are the values that we store at timestep t the same values that we put into the network at timestep t? In other words, are the network outputs at timestep t calculated with the values stored at timestep t?

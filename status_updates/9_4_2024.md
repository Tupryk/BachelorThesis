# Status update for the 9th of April 2024

## Progress
- Read some papers and started using Zotero:
    - NeuroBEM: Hybrid Aerodynamic Quadrotor Mode
    - Minimum Snap Trajectory Generation and Control for Quadrotors
    - Learning-based Multirotor System Model Enhancements (Previous Bachelor thesis)
- Started preparing the code to feed the drone state into the neural network under app_nn
- Played around with cflib

## Plans for next week
- Try out CrazySwarm (Didn't have a working Ubuntu machine in Spain)

## To discuss
- Wrote a script to fly the CrazyFlie with cflib under flight_with_python_cflib/main. Setting a negative y velocity doesn't make it go down, why is this?
- Don't quite undestand the outputs of the models. Why force and torque? Whats the difference between the force and the torque? How do I use this to improve flight?

# Status update for the 9th of April 2024

## Progress
- Read some papers and started using Zotero:
    - NeuroBEM: Hybrid Aerodynamic Quadrotor Mode
    - Minimum Snap Trajectory Generation and Control for Quadrotors
    - Learning-based Multirotor System Model Enhancements (Previous Bachelor thesis)
- Started preparing the code to feed the drone state into the neural network under app_nn
- Played around with cflib

## Plans for next week
- Try out CrazySwarm (Didn't have a working Ubuntu machine in Spain)
- Organize a list of models with different input features and sizes and see which one works best and fastest

## To discuss
- Wrote a script to fly the CrazyFlie with cflib under flight_with_python_cflib/main. Setting a negative y-velocity doesn't make it go down, why is this?
- In one of Jana's models (the one in model.py), in addition to the acceleration and gyroscope measurements, we take the first two rows of the quadrotor's rotation matrix as input. Why not just take the three rotation angles or directly take the quaternion instead of this specific area of the rotation matrix?
- Is the scaling of the model input data really necessary? gyro -> randians, acc * gravity

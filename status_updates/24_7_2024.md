# Status update for the 17th of July 2024 (12 weeks left)

## Progress

## Plans for next week

## To discuss
- How do I get the pwm values in the controller code to feed into the standard residual calculator?
- The normalization values of the pwm values vary from flight to flight, which ones are the correct one? Can I just take any flight? (look at `./standard_residual_calc_c/`)

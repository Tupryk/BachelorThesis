# Status update for the 17th of July 2024 (12 weeks left)

## Progress
- Measured the onboard inference time of the two models:
    - DTE: 31.25 Hz
    - NN: 15.75 Hz
- Created two new models (nn and dte) that only output Fx and Fy and compared their avg. error (in newtons) (these results vary from run to run, but seem to be consistent in the dte outperforming the nn):
    - DTE: (x) -> 0.0012 (y) -> 0.0015
    - NN: (x) -> 0.0018 (y) -> 0.0019
- Continued writing the thesis

## Plans for next week
- Compare flight performance improvement with different models (First choose the final models to be tested)

## To discuss
- How do I get the pwm values in the controller code to feed into the standard residual calculator?
- The normalization values of the pwm values vary from flight to flight, which ones are the correct one? Can I just take any flight? (look at `./standard_residual_calc_c/`) (Alternative is to just use one of the polynomials from the system-id repo)

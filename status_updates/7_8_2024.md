# Status update for the 7th of August 2024 (10 weeks left)

## Progress
- Tested the brushless crazyflie with a neural network, here are the average errors for flights of timescale .6:
    - No NN: 0.14 (Averaged over 5 flights in figure 8)
    - NN: 0.11 (Averaged over 3 flights in figure 8)
    - This is a higher error overall when compared to the standard crazyflie, it could lie in the calculation of the error or the innacuracies when tracking the brushless crazyflie.

## Plans for next week

## To discuss
- Should I change the error calculation function? for each flight the recording of the state starts at a different point, so sometimes the error arrows can be skewed relative to other flights. I was thinking of calculating a cutoff for the data at each flight with an optimization problem.

# Status update for the 6th of September 2024 (6 weeks left)

## Progress
- Can't run sim -> need to compile cffirmware python bindings -> can't find swig
- Wrote a new notebook detailing the process of using the decision tree ensembles
- Fixed some issues with the compressed tree conversion
- Unable to run real world tests on smaller computer get a ros2 error: some function in ros is deprecated
- Looked into Dennis' code for payload residual calculation, uses a different data format, requires some extra keys that our data does not have
- Did some tets fligts with the decision tree ensemble and standard residual calculation, as well as the just the lee controller and neural network: (timescale .6 on figure8)
    - Avg. error for 'lee': 0.13349 (m) for the invidual flights: [0.13265049481819421, 0.13694333235273984, 0.13339751793545943, 0.13115956600000897, 0.13531140583192675, 0.13263341601842876, 0.135313974345844, 0.13049556399950185]

    - Avg. inf time for 'standard': inf (Hz)

    - Avg. error for 'tree': 0.12786 (m) for the invidual flights: [0.12909715961567425, 0.12370056256483578, 0.13250050022124518, 0.12412107008589478, 0.12422766502277799, 0.13008948868566003, 0.12916898402025864, 0.12996813349254252]
    - Avg. inf time for 'tree': inf (Hz)

## Plans for next week

## To discuss
- Played around with some new neural network sizes to see if I could get better performance than the decision tree ensemble. Should I just use the parameters specified in jana's thesis or should I try to get a better nn performance?

# Status update for the 4th of September 2024 (6 weeks left)

## Progress
- Can't run sim -> need to compile cffirmware python bindings -> can't find swig
- Wrote a new notebook detailing the process of using the decision tree ensembles
- Fixed some issues with the compressed tree conversion
- Unable to run real world tests
    - Small computer gives a ros2 error: some function in ros is deprecated
    - Bigger computer: Doesn't show anything on NiceGUI
- Looked into Dennis' code for payload residual calculation, uses a different data format, requires some extra keys that our data does not have

## Plans for next week

## To discuss
- Played around with some new neural network sizes to see if I could get better performance than the decision tree ensemble. Should I just use the parameters specified in jana's thesis or should I try to get a better nn performance?

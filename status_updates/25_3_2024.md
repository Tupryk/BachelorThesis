### Status update for the 25th of March 2024

# Progress
- Created a python script to translate .pth files into c code, based off of the example code send via slack.
- Tested if the model output for the generated c code matched the model output by loading the .pth file with PyTorch. (It does)
- Compiled and flashed the CrazyFlie firmware.
- Ran some example flight code from https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-lib-python on the CrazyFlie.
- Ran the model (model_1.pth) on the app layer and got around 20 Hz average runtime over 100 runs.

# Plans for next week
- Improve c code (Or look into rust?)

# To discuss
- Is there any particular reason why we specifically use jana02 for testing and we don't use some random set? (Also, why are there some jumps like from jana06 to jana10)
- The model defined in model.py and model_1.pth are not the same. Which one is the correct one? model_1.pth has an extra layer with 10 nodes.
- Do we want to have the model on the app layer?
- I'm not sure if I got the millisecond measurement right.
- How should I test the model?
- (Just for fun) Would it make sense to try out different learning methods like an evolutionary algorithm?

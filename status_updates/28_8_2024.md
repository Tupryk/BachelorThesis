# Status update for the 28th of August 2024 (7 weeks left)

## Progress
- Faced various issues when trying to fly with the payload so was not able to test the neural network
- Looked into more decision tree pruning methods as disscused with Pia, managed to reduce the size of the trees by 75% with the min_samples_split=200 (accuracy drops only a bit) value in sklearn. This is however still pretraining. Now it is possible to load the model into the crazyflie, after transforming the model into the optimal c code written previously.

## Plans for next week
- Test on sim
- Payload testing
- Finish thesis text
- Test nn, tree and basic on brushless and standard
- Calculate payload residuals with dennis' model

## To discuss
- In the residual calculation for the payload system, written by wolfgang in the crazyflie system-id payload, there is no -1 when tranforming the acceleration from the cf coordinates to the world coordinates, this however gets done in the firware and in jana's calculation. Is it correct?

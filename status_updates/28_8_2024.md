# Status update for the 28th of August 2024 (7 weeks left)

## Progress
- Faced various issues when trying to fly with the payload so was not able to test the neural network

## Plans for next week

## To discuss
- In the residual calculation for the payload system, written by wolfgang in the crazyflie system-id payload, there is no -1 when tranforming the acceleration from the cf coordinates to the world coordinates, this however gets done in the firware and in jana's calculation. Is it correct?

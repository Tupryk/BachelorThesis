# Status update for the 23th of April 2024

## Progress
- Did some test flights with crazyswarm and stored the flight data into an sd card.
- Made a python script to convert xgboost decision tree ensembles into c code (Still not fully tested, but it seems fine so far)
- Started writing the thesis.

## Plans for next week

## To discuss
- Where exactly should I put the model in the firmware?
- Is the c code generated for the decision tree ensembles good? It tends to get really long with the amount of n_estimators and output variables, is this a problem?
- The outputs of the models generated with xgboost dont seem to correspond with the tree's output leaves when there is just a single tree, am I missing something? Using sklearn to generate the trees this does not happen.
- Did the model outputs of the previous bachelor thesis ever get scaled back? I printed the output error and checked if they are the same as on the pdf. They are the same, however in the thesis pdf it says that these errors are in the scaled back units (N and rad/s^2) but I can't find where in the code this scaling happens. In the data plotting functions model_error_f and model_error_tau (inside plot_data.py) there is even a variable called scaler that does not get used.

# Status update for the 23th of April 2024

## Progress
- Made a python script to convert xgboost decision tree ensembles into c code (Still not fully tested, but it seems fine so far) (I know this wasn't and objective for this meeting but I wanted to try it out anyway)

## Plans for next week

## To discuss
- Is the c code generated for the decision tree ensembles good? It tends to get really long with the amount of n_estimators and output variables, is this a problem?
- The outputs of the models generated with xgboost dont seem to correspond with the tree's output leaves when there is just a single tree, am I missing something? Using sklearn to generate the trees this does not happen.

# Status update for the 7th of May 2024

## Progress
- Continued writing the thesis
- Did some test flights with different changes to the lee controller, all on the figure8.csv flight path (Some of the results are in the overleaf document):
    - First tested just the standard lee controller
    - Adding the output for the force without scaling
    - Adding the output for the force with scaling
    - Adding the torque with and without scaling

## Plans for next week
- Measure model inference time

## To discuss
- When writing the thesis, how in depth should I go into how the models where developed since i'm just uploading them into the crazyflie?
- Next steps for testing the model

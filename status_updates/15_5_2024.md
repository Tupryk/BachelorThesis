# Status update for the 15th of May 2024

## Progress
- Added table of contents to the thesis paper
- Readded pwm log values to src/drivers/src/motors.c
- Compared measured residual with model predicted residual
- Compared c model output to pytorch model output again
- Fixed model acceleration and rotation input
    - Two values in the rotation matrix input to the model where slightly off
    - The acceleration inputs where taken from the state estimate rather than the sensor data
- Velocity v force comparison:

## Plans for next week
- Plot force vectors in position v desired trajectory graph
- Check model output scales

## To discuss
- xgboost decision tree ensemble
- I'm only able to log 21 values at a time
- Am I applying the neural network output to the right places in controller_lee.c?

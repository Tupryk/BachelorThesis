# Status update for the 5th of June 2024 (19 weeks left)

## Progress
- Created an error metric. Summed the eucledian distances to the desired path.

## Plans for next week
- Acceleration to world frame or take from state estimate acceleration (stabilizer.c)
    - Neural swarm code
- u vector with rpm to residual calculation
- Compare rpm thrust and pwm thrust

## To discuss
- Trying to calculate the residual forces with rpm
    - What is the thrust coefficient?
    - What is the torque coefficient?
